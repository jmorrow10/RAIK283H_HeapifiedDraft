4) The scema of the element has itself, a parent, a child array, height, and an id
5) The rank of the nodes
6) Instead of swapping indexes of elements, it completly redefines the element
7)                  1
                   / \
                  2   3
                 / \ / 
                4  5 6

8)  1: Parents: Und, Children: 2,3, height: 0
    2: Parents: 1,   Children: 4,5, height: 1
    3: Parents: 1,   Children: 6,   height: 1
    4: Parents: 2,   Children: Und, height: 2
    5: Parents: 2,   Children: Und, height: 2
    6: Parents: 3,   Children: Und, height: 2

9) The insertion vertex is 7 and the removal vertex is 1

10) Same without the 1 with 2 as the new parent

11) 0 would be the new root

12) A heap insertion

13) Metric is the identity of the node to remove

15) The idea of shifting nodes was interesting to wrap my head around
